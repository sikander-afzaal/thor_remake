                  With Decentralized Finance, we can leverage blockchain ran
                  economy models. This creates community ran economies where
                  players can earn tokens while they play. The community also
                  holds power with Gods of Asgard, with the ability to vote on
                  future updates and improvements.

                  Using Blockchain technology, players can own their characters
                  and other in-game assets. In traditional gaming, developers of
                  the game own and control all assets. Players are free to sell,
                  purchase, and trade the blockchain assets including character
                  NFTs and tokens earned.
